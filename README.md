Dart-Diameter
Dart-Diameter is a library for supporting the diameter protocol. It contains raw protocol support, message and AVP encoders/decoders and various classes for implementing different diameter node types (proxies, servers, clients, online charging systems ...). It is dictionary-less and schema-less.

It is designed to be lean and mean with as few dependencies as possible.
